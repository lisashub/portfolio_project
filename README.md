# Twitter Trends Mining and Trend Analysis
This project uses Twitter's API to mine user content for the latest trending topics for Milwaukee and worldwide, then compares each geolocation to identify common topics. This project was inspired by an outdated library book I'd come across and a desire to practice developing solutions despite not having all the required tools/information readily available.
